To Do:
-> Discussion of denormalized numbers. What is the smallest normal number? Image of the spacing of floats.
-> have everyone type and then run the denormalized numbers code in python with +, - 0.1
-> Then ask them to change the +, - to 0, and have them run it again.
-> Now show the matrix multiplication codes in c++ and python. Show how run time is drastically affected in c++.
-> Have them translate the code into matlab. Demonstrate the code in c++ and python at the same time so they can translate the one they prefer.
